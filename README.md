# kanban-js
Simple Kan Ban style board written using only HTML, CSS and JS. A first excercise to put in practice the use of Classes, DOM Manipulation and Event handlers. 

#Todo: clean up all the consolo logs. fix appereance of droppable areas once the drop event happens. maybe refactor using callbacks for handling other lists? Wlil come back to it eventually.
